# 19-bit CPU Architecture in VHDL

This project implements a custom 19-bit CPU in VHDL, designed for special-purpose operations such as signal processing and cryptography. The CPU is equipped with dedicated instructions for FFT, encryption, and decryption, and features a simple 5-stage pipeline architecture.

## Features

- **19-bit instruction size** and **19-bit data width**
- **16 general-purpose registers** (19 bits each)
- **Specialized instructions** for FFT, encryption, and decryption
- Support for **arithmetic, logical, control flow, and memory access instructions**
- **Simple pipeline** with five stages: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write-back
- **Harvard architecture** with separate instruction and data memory
- **Memory size**: 2^19 (524,288) addresses, each storing 19-bit data

## Architecture Overview

### Register File
- 16 general-purpose registers (`gp_reg[0:15]`), each 19 bits wide.

### Memory Interface
- Memory size of 524,288 addresses (2^19), each capable of holding a 19-bit word.
- Separate instruction and data memory (Harvard architecture).

### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, INC, and DEC.
- Supports logical operations: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

### Specialized Operations
- **FFT**: Fast Fourier Transform for signal processing.
- **ENC**: Encryption using a predefined algorithm.
- **DEC**: Decryption using a predefined algorithm.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Fetch**: Retrieve the instruction from memory using the program counter (PC).
2. **Decode**: Decode the instruction to identify the opcode and operands.
3. **Execute**: Perform the operation specified by the opcode.
4. **Memory Access**: Access memory if the instruction is a load or store.
5. **Write-back**: Store the result back into the destination register.

## Instruction Set Architecture

With a 19-bit instruction size, the instruction fields are defined as follows:
- **Opcode**: `inst(18 downto 14)` (5 bits)
- **Register r1**: `inst(13 downto 10)` (4 bits)
- **Register r2**: `inst(9 downto 6)` (4 bits)
- **Register r3**: `inst(5 downto 2)` (4 bits)
